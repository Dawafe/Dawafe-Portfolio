    <div id="story">My name is Dan. I am web developer and closet nerd who has recently discovered the joys of coding. I liken development to LEGOS; as the possibilities are seemingly endless, and yet the natural limitations of the systems force an innovative challenge on my creativity and problem solving.
      I learned to code in 2021. For some, the desire to work from home after the experience of the 2020 pandemic led them to pursue this field. However, my motivation for moving into web development was one rooted in a desire to find an occupation that fit my personality, skills, and will bring more satisfaction to my soul. I dabbled in Python to begin with, and soon realized that I wanted to build things that would have direct interaction with the end user. So web development was an obvious attraction. It has not dissapointed. Continue on to see some of my for-fun projects.</div>

        <li>Idea:</li>
        <li>Every morning as I help and spur my 3 young children to get dressed for the day, I open up my phone and check the weather forecast for the day. We live in Colorado, and like many other places, you can't really trust the predictions until the morning of. I decided to make a simple web app that will send me a text every morning before "go time" that has the high temp and precipitation forecast for the day.<li>
