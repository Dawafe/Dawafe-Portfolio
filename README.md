# Dawafe-Portfolio

- If you are here as a friend, employer, client, random person, or other, please forward any suggestions or help! I want all the smoke. Jk.
- "Dawafe" is my (potential) brand, and is simply the first two letters of my names combined. Don't even trip dawg.

- This site is both an active project and my portfolio for potential employers and clients.
- I fully intend for this site to grow and evolve along with my skill.
- I am currently dissatisfied with it's pazazz, and will be looking for ways to add fun things like animations and whatnot.
